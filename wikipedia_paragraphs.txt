Tariffsimplemented during thesecond presidency of Donald Trumphave marked a sharp escalation inprotectionisttrade policies in the United States, with PresidentDonald Trumpannouncing a series of steep tariffs on nearly all goods imported to the US. From January to April 2025, the US trade-weighted average tariff rose from 2% to an estimated 24%, the highest level in over a century.[2]\n
Trump escalated an ongoingtrade war with China, raising baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to an effective 145% after April 9, 2025.[3]He also initiated a newtrade war with Canada and Mexicoby imposing a 25% tariff on most goods from the countries, though he later granted indefinite exemptions for goods compliant with theUSMCA. Trump framed these actions as a way to hold the countries accountable for contrabanddrug traffickingandillegal immigrationwhile supportingdomestic manufacturing.[4][5]He later imposed a 25% tariff on imported steel, aluminum, andautomobilesfrom all countries, with tariffs on auto parts expected to follow.\n
On April 2—a day he called "Liberation Day"—Trump signed anexecutive orderimposing a minimum 10% tariff on all U.S. imports effective April 5. Higher tariffs on imports from 57 countries, ranging from 11% to 50%, were scheduled to take effect on April 9 but were almost immediately suspended for 90 days for all countries except China. The 10% tariff remains in effect.[6]\n
The announcement of these controversially[7][8][9][10]termed "reciprocal tariffs" prompted retaliation from trade partners and triggereda stock market crash.[11][12]According to the Trump administration's reciprocal tariff formula,trade deficitsare viewed as inherently harmful and should be eliminated.[13]Economists cited by the administration said their research had been misinterpreted and that the administration's formula and goals were simplistic and illogical.[14][15]Media outlets argued the tariffs were notreciprocalbut rather unilateralprotective tariffs.[16]The tariffs have contributed to lowered GDP growth projections by theFederal ReserveandOECDand rising expectations of arecession.\n
Since the 1980s, Trump has advocated forimport tariffsas a tool to regulate trade and retaliate against foreign nations that he believes have been disadvantageous to Americans.[17]In his campaigns for the US presidency, Trump promised to use tariffs to achieve a wide range of goals, including preventing war, reducingtrade deficits, improvingborder security, and subsidizing childcare.[18]Although Trump has said foreign countries pay his tariffs, US tariffs arefeespaid by US consumers and businesses either directly or in the form of increased prices.[19][18][20][21]Shortly after being reelected, Trump acknowledged that tariffs might cause "some pain" for Americans but insisted "it will all be worth the price that must be paid".[22]\n
In 2018, Trump imposedtariffs on steel and aluminumimports, resulting in price increases for Americans.[23]In December 2021, the price of one metric ton of hot-rolled band steel was $1,855 in the US compared to $646 in China and $1,031 in Europe.[24]TheWorld Trade Organization(WTO), a watchdog forinternational trade, later ruled that the implementation violated global trade rules.[25]While he and his first successor,Joe Biden, rolled back some of these tariffs, most remained in place by the start ofTrump's second term.[26]Trump also launched atrade war with Chinawhich subjected 60% of US-China trade to 20% tariffs[27]and was widely characterized as a failure for the United States.[28]\n
In May 2019, Trump used tariff threats of up to 25% on Mexico to negotiate an expansion of his "Remain in Mexico" policy and the deployment of Mexican soldiers to help controlillegal immigration.[29]Mexico deployed nearly 15,000 troops to its border with the US and 6,500 troops to its border withGuatemala.[30]In 2020, the US, Mexico and Canada renegotiatedNAFTAas theUnited States–Mexico–Canada Agreement(USMCA) and recommitted to 0% tariffs on most products traded between them. Five weeks after the USMCA went into effect, Trump used an exemption for national security concerns to implement a 10% tariff on Canadian aluminum after claiming it was flooding the US market.[31][32]He withdrew the tariff a month later, three hours before Canada planned to retaliate.[33]\n
While campaigningfor his second term as US president, Trump pledged even larger tariffs thanhis first term, including 60% on China, 100% on Mexico, and 20% on all other countries. He also proposed tariffs to penalize US companies that outsourced manufacturing, such as a 200% tariff onJohn Deere. Trump also suggested replacingincome taxeswith tariff revenue—an idea economists from theTax Foundationdeemed "mathematically impossible".[34]23Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter warning that Trump's policies, including high tariffs, would "lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality".[35][36]\n
Trump appointed close economic advisorPeter Navarroas hisSenior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing. Navarro had been recently imprisoned for defyingcongressional subpoenasrelated to his role inattempts to overturn the 2020 election, including his "Green Bay Sweep" strategy.[37]Navarro advocates for a permanent regime of trade barriers to balance the trade deficit and wrote books criticizing corporations for prioritizing profits over American jobs. He had served in high-ranking trade roles during Trump's first term but was often rebuffed byfree market-minded Trump administration officials such asGary Cohn, who resigned in protest of Trump's 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs.[38]TheFinancial Timesreported Navarro would receive more influence and less opposition in Trump's second administration. Navarro began working closely with cabinet nomineesHoward LutnickandJamieson Greer.[39]ING Groupnoted that plans for Trump's "reciprocal tariff" policy appeared to align with Navarro's section ofProject 2025, titled "The Case for Fair Trade".[40]\n
Shortly after the 2024 election,Stephen Miran, now chairman of theCouncil of Economic Advisersunder Trump, released a white paper titled "A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System,"[41]which proposed using tariffs as a tool to drive down the value of the dollar through a negotiated 'Mar-a-Lago Accord'.[42]Miran and other key figures in the administration have suggested that the dollar is significantly overvalued because of its status as aglobal reserve currency,[43]and that tariffs can be used to weaken the dollar and revitalize American manufacturing,[44]although this view has been criticized by some economists.[45]While the administration's ultimate tariff formula[46]did not closely resemble any of Miran's suggestions, the underlying ideas in Miran's white paper remain important in the Trump administration's conduct of trade policy.[42][47]\n
Duringhis inaugural addresson January 20, 2025, Trump pledged to "immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens."[48]\n
On March 4, 2025, the US notified the WTO that it would suspend planned contributions indefinitely. The US was set to provide about 11% of the WTO's $232 million 2024 budget, a fee based on the country's share of global trade.[49]On March 26UPSlaunched a tool allowing online shoppers to view the added cost of tariffs at checkout instead of being surprised by additional costs when their parcel arrived.[50]\n
Although theUS ConstitutiongrantsCongressthe sole authority to levy taxes, including tariffs, Congress has passed laws allowing the President to impose tariffs for national security reasons unilaterally.[51]In his second term, Trump added tariffs to steel, aluminum, and auto imports under Section 232 of theTrade Expansion Act(TEA), which allows the President to modify imports if theSecretary of Commerceconducts an investigation, holds public hearings, and determines that the imports threaten national security.[52][53]Trump directed theUSTRto initiate similar investigations to impose tariffs underSection 301of theTrade Act of 1974.[54]\n
Trump also invoked unprecedented powers under theNational Emergencies Act(NEA) and theInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act(IEEPA) by declaringmultiple "national emergencies"related to border security, energy, and trade deficits.[55][56]Declaring these emergencies allowed Trump to quickly enact tariffs without following the complex procedures required by TEA or other trade statutes.[57]While the IEEPA had been used forsanctions, it had never before been used for tariffs. As he signed the orders, Trump stated that declaring an emergency "means you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem."[55]The New York Timesreported that "many economists and legal experts believe that the idea of an emergency has been concocted to justify Mr. Trump's desire to impose sweeping import duties without regard to congressional approval or international trade rules."[58]\n
To terminate a national emergency under the NEA, a member of Congress can file a privileged resolution requiring theirchamberto vote on the topic within 15 days. In February 2025,DemocraticSenatorsTim KaineandMark Warnerintroduced a resolution to end Trump's national emergency on energy, but it was defeated by the Senate'sRepublicanmajority.[59]The Senate passed a resolution to terminate the national emergency justifying tariffs on Canada, but the bill is unlikely to pass the House.[60]A provision was added to theMarch 2025 budget billto block the process by declaring that the remainder of the year "shall not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act."[61][62][63]\n
On March 12, 2025, the US imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, aiming to strengthen domestic production.[64]On April 2, 2025, aluminum tariffs expanded to include empty aluminumcansand canned beer.[65]The measures expanded Trump's first-term steel and aluminum tariffs by eliminating all exemptions and raising the aluminum tariff from 10% to 25%.[52]The administration argued previous exemptions "inadvertently created loopholes that were exploited by China and others with excess steel and aluminum capacity".[66]Trump also mandated that steel be "melted and poured" and aluminum "smelted and cast" in the US to qualify for duty-free status to prevent tariff circumvention.[67]Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnicksaid Trump would soon add a copper tariff as well.[68]\n
In 2023, the US imported 44% of its aluminum and 26% of its steel.[69]Canada was its largest supplier of both, accounting for more than half of aluminum[70]and two-thirds of primary aluminum imports.[69]While the US was the world's largest producer of aluminum through 2000, it accounted for less than 2% of the global supply by 2021, largely due to high electricity costs that made itless competitivein the global market.[71]In 2021, primary aluminumsmeltersoperated at 55% capacity in the US compared to 95% in Canada and 88% globally. The US remained a major producer of less energy-intensive secondary aluminum, but secondary aluminum is less desirable for defense or electronics.[71]\n
In January 2025, President Trump announced broad tariffs on Canada and Mexico, threatening the highly integrated North American auto supply chain.[72]Due to decades of free trade agreements includingUSMCA, factories in the US, Canada, and Mexico grew accustomed to shipping auto parts back and forth multiple times during the manufacturing process.[72]The three largest US automakers—Ford,General Motors, andStellantis—lobbied for exemptions, warning the tariffs would hurt American companies more than foreign competitors.[73]Ford CEOJim Farleywarned investors, "Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen."[72]Trump agreed to delayed tariffs on USMCA-compliant vehicles.[74]Still, non-USMCA compliant brands manufacturing in Canada or Mexico, such asBMW, were affected starting March 4, 2025.[73]BMW chose to cover these tariffs until May 1, 2025.[75]\n
The USMCA exemption closed on April 3, when Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all imported cars, including those from Mexico and Canada.[76]The tariff will extend to non-US content in domestically assembled vehicles "no later than May 3".[77]The White House argued the move would boost domestic manufacturing and generate $100 billion in tax revenue,[78]noting that about 50% of the 16 million cars bought by Americans in 2024 were imported.[79]The same day, Stellantis announced it would temporarily close factories in Canada and Mexico and lay off 900 American employees as it assessed the impact of tariffs.[80]\n
On February 21, 2025, Trump issued a presidential memorandum ordering theOffice of the United States Trade Representative(USTR) as well as other officials, including Peter Navarro, to investigate digital service taxes (DSTs) and determine whether to take retaliatory action. A fact sheet accompanying the memo emphasized that the European Union'sDigital Markets Act(DMA) andDigital Services Act(DSA) would face scrutiny.[81]\n
DSTs are taxes on revenue from digital services, such as online advertising and selling user data. These taxes allow countries to collect revenue from multinational companies that provide digital services in their jurisdiction.[81]USTR investigations initiated during Trump's first term led to tariff threats on several countries under authority granted by section 301 of theTrade Act of 1974.[54]On October 8, 2021, over 135 countries participating in theOECDnegotiations agreed on a two-pillar approach to reform and withdraw DSTs called the "Global tax deal". The Pillar One deadline was December 31, 2023, but it was subsequently extended to December 31, 2024.[81]As of January 2025, Trump withdrew from Pillar Two of the agreement, and many countries' DSTs remain in effect.[82][81]\n
"Secondary tariffs" are a new trade policy introduced by the second Trump administration that resemblessecondary sanctions.[83]Unlike primary tariffs, which directly target a specific country, secondary tariffs penalize the third-party countries or entities that trade with the targeted nation.[84]On March24, following actions such as theMarch 2025 Venezuelan deportations, Trump signed anexecutive orderimposing a 25% tariff on nations that purchase oil fromVenezuelaat the Secretary of State's discretion.[85]He subsequently threatened secondary tariffs on countries buying Russian oil, unless Russia agreed to apeace treaty with Ukraine,[86]and on countries that trade withIran.[87]\n
Trump's February 2025 executive orders announcing tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada initially suspended the USde minimisexemption.[88]Thede minimisexemption waives standard customs procedures on low-value packages to reduce administrative burdens.US Congressquadrupled thede minimisthreshold from $200 to $800 in 2016, resulting in an over 1000% increase in shipments claiming the exemption by 2023.[89][90]The US exemption was among the highest globally, over five times the size of theEuropean Union's, and used by many companies to send goods to the US without close inspection or taxes.[90]The largest beneficiaries were Chinesee-commercecompanies such asSheinandAliExpress. Some shipments were linked to drug trafficking.[89]However, by February 7, 2025, Trump indefinitely restored thede minimisexemption for all three target countries to avoid overwhelmingUS customs officials.[91][92][93]\n
On April 2, 2025, Trump closed the exemption for China and Hong Kong again, starting May 2. Imports will be subject to all duties unless shipped via the Universal Postal Union (UPU). UPU packages will receive a duty of 30% of value or $25 per item—rising to $50 after June 1. The Commerce Secretary will report within 90 days on the impact and whether to includeMacau. Trump also directed that the de minimis exemption be phased out for all tariffed countries once "adequate systems are in place" to fully collect duties.[94]\n
On February 13, 2025, Trump directed his staff to research both monetary and non-monetarytrade barriersimposed by other countries and to develop custom "reciprocal tariffs" for each one to counter and penalize them.[58]He instructed them to consider factors such as existing tariffs, exchange rates, and trade balances in their analysis. Lutnick said his team would have a plan ready by April 1, 2025.[97]Trump announced that he would unveil the reciprocal tariffs on April 2, 2025, a date he referred to as "Liberation Day".[98][99]\n
On April 2, 2025, Trump declared a national emergency to address what he described as a "large and persistent US trade deficit", enabling him to invoke theIEEPAto impose a 10% tariff on all imports to the US, effective April 5, 2025.[56]He also announced higher tariffs for 57 countries and territories set to begin April 9.[100]The White House said these tariff would be applied in addition to existing measures on Chinese imports, resulting in an effective tariff rate of 54% on Chinese goods after April 9, 2025.[101]Politicodescribed the measures as "the most significant US protectionist trade action since the 1930s", when Congress passed theSmoot–Hawley Tariff Act.[56]Federal Reserve chairmanJerome Powelldescribed the tariffs, and their likely economic impact, as "significantly larger than expected."[102]\n
The following goods were not impacted by additional tariffs, including the 10% baseline tariff:[103]\n
Reutersreported the Trump administration struggled to design reciprocal tariffs because each of the 186 members of theWorld Customs Organizationapplied different duties.[106]The administration initially considered dividing all countries into tiers of high, medium, and low trade barriers.[107]Later, Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentand National Economic Council directorKevin HassetttoldFox Businessthat the administration would focus on the United States' largest trading partners and assign individualized tariff rates.[107][98]Hassett stated that "more than 100 countries don't really have any tariffs on us and don't have any non-tariff barriers" and that only "10 to 15 countries" were a concern.[98]\n
However, on March 30 Trump told reporters, "I don't know who told you 10 or 15", dismissing the idea as a "rumor" and saying he would impose tariffs on "all countries".[108][109]Although many countries attempted to negotiate deals in the weeks leading up to April 2, no exemptions were granted.[110][111]The lack of clarity contributed to economic volatility and the beginning of the 2025 stock market crash.[112][113][114]\n
Bloomberg Newsreported Navarro urged Trump to adopt a 25% minimum import tariff or a "reciprocal" tariff formula based on trade deficits, while Bessent and Hassett proposed more nuanced and targeted tariffs. Bessent encouraged the use of tariffs primarily as a negotiating tool, while Navarro saw them as means to transform trade relationships. Ultimately, Trump adopted Navarro's idea of "reciprocal" tariffs.[115][116]\n
Soon after the unveiling, financial journalistJames Surowieckireported that the final "reciprocal tariff" policy appeared to calculate the value of a country's trade barriers by dividing the US trade deficit with the country by the value of US imports from the country, where both the trade deficit and the imports focus only on goods, rather than both goods and services.[46][117]The "reciprocal" tariff rate Trump imposed was then calculated by dividing that value in half.[118]For example, dividing the US's 2024 trade deficit in goods with China, $295 billion, by the amount that the US imported from China, $439 billion, results in the 67% trade barrier value the US assigned to China: $295bn ÷ $439bn = 0.67 which, as a percentage, is 67%.[119]\n
The Trump administration later published their trade barrier formula online, whichsimplifiedto the same formula.[46][120]With variableirepresenting a country,mirepresenting imports of goods from that country, andxirepresenting exports of goods to that country, the formula given by the White House is as follows:\n
The Trump administration formula included measures ofelasticityset atε= 4 andφ= 0.25, then multiplied them forε×φ= 1, which resulted in no change whenε×φwas multiplied to other parts of the calculation as defined in the formula.[46]Thus, withxi−mibeing the trade deficit for goods, the formula simplifies to Surowiecki's:\n
The reciprocal tariff rate is then roughly calculated by multiplying the result by 1/2, making the final formula:\n
The Trump administration'sOffice of the United States Trade Representative(USTR) explained that the tariffs "are calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits between the U.S. and each of our trading partners", aiming to "drive bilateral trade deficits to zero".[121]However, even countries with which the US runs a trade surplus, such as Australia, received a tariff of 10%.[122]\n
USTR cited research papers by several economists, many of whom publicly criticized the formula and stated the White House had misinterpreted and incorrectly applied their research.[14]Anson Soderbery, whose work was cited, said his research was meant to discourage exactly the types of policies the White House was implementing.[14]Brent Neimansaid the administration used the wrong variable from his research—leading to results four times too high—and that trade deficits reflect economic fundamentals, not unfair trade.[15]\n
Some economists likened fears over trade deficits to worrying about having a "deficit" with a grocery store, emphasizing that buying more than you sell in a mutually beneficial exchange is not inherently problematic.[123][124]Economic experts criticized the formula for being overly simplistic with little relation to trade barriers,[14][125][126][127]withThe Economistdescribing it as "almost as random as taxing you on the number of vowels in your name."[128]Some media outlets noted that this was the same formula that was obtained by askingChatGPTand otherlarge language modelsfor a global tariff formula that compensates for trade deficit.[129][130][131]\n
Treasury SecretaryScott Bessenttold "every country" on April 3: "do not retaliate, sit back, take it in, let's see how it goes, because, if you retaliate, there will be escalation."[132]After the stock market lost significant value the next day, President Trump said events were "going very well" and "markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom."[133]On April 6, while the stock markets continued to fall, Trump said that his tariffs "are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold."[134]\n
The White House's initial list of impacted areas included theHeard Island and McDonald Islands, a remote uninhabitedAntarcticterritory of Australia.[135]A tariff of 29% was proposed forNorfolk Island, which has a population around 2,000 and also belongs to Australia; the rest of Australia received a tariff of 10%.[136]The initial list also proposed tariffs of 10% on theBritish Indian Ocean Territory, whose population is solely composed of the inhabitants of the joint American-British military base ofDiego Garcia, numbering some 3,000 American and British military contractors.[137]The decision to impose tariffs on some of these regions appears to have been based on inaccurate trade data. An analysis of United States import records byThe Guardianrevealed that some shipments were erroneously recorded as originating from remote territories instead of their actual countries of origin. These misclassified imports included items such as wine, aquarium systems, andTimberlandboots.[138]\n
The highest tariffs of 50% were placed onLesotho, described by Trump as a country that "nobody had ever heard of"; a 50% tariff was also initially proposed for France'sSaint Pierre and Miquelonislands, with a population of around 5,000.[135]Other countries facing some of the highest tariffs are Cambodia (49%), Laos (48%), Madagascar (47%), Vietnam (46%), and Myanmar (44%).[139]\n
Six countries were exempted from reciprocal tariffs:Belarus, Canada,Cuba, Mexico,North Korea, and Russia.[better source needed]Press SecretaryKaroline Leavittcommented this was because Trump previously imposed tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico for non-USMCA goods. She claimed Russia escaped tariffs because current American sanctions on Russia resulted in no "meaningful trade" between the two countries. However, in 2024, the value of this trade was $3.5 billion, greater than countries such asMauritius, orBrunei, who were tariffed heavily from this round of tariffs. Leavitt cited that the tariffs and sanctions on Belarus, Cuba, and North Korea were already high.[140]However,Iran, andSyria, which had been under American sanctions for 20 years, did receive a high Liberation Day tariff of 41%.[141]\n
On April 9, Trump announced onTruth Socialthat reciprocal tariffs above 10%, which had gone into effect that morning, would be paused for 90 days for all countries except China. China's minimum tariff rate was increased to 145%,[3]while imports from all other countries were sustained at the 10% baseline tariff.[142]Other global tariffs on products like cars, steel and aluminum remained in effect.[143]The administration exempted goods that were already in transit and that arrive before May 27, 2025, from the new tariffs.[144]\n
Politicoreported that Bessent had flown to Florida a few days earlier to lobby Trump against the tariffs, warning him that the stock market would continue to decline unless he changed course.[145]After the walk back, Bessent said the pause was meant to provide time for bespoke negotiations with each trading partner.[146]Trump told reporters, "I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line … You know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid".[147]He said he had been watching thebond market, which had shown signs ofcrashingthe night before.[148]\n
Stocks surged within minutes of the announcement, with the S&P 500 rising more than 7%.[149]Citianalysts warned, "We do not see the scenario as being as encouraging as markets do," noting that the remaining tariffs still represented a substantial new burden.[150]Despite the partial rollback, analysts atBloomberg Economicsestimated the US's average effective tariff rate was still set to rise to 24% from 22% the year prior.Pacific Investment Management, one of the world's biggest bond investors, kept estimates of a US recession at 50/50 "even if the 90-day reprieve turns into a longer stint".[2]On April 11, the administration announced it would further exempt electronics such as smartphones and computers from the reciprocal tariffs, but warned they may be subject to future Section 232 tariffs. Chinese technology imports would continue to face a 20% tariff.[151]\n
Three weeks after Trump won reelection, he announced a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico unless they took action against illegal immigration and drug trafficking, particularlyfentanyl. Mexican PresidentClaudia Sheinbaumand then-Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeausought to de-escalate tensions.[152][153]While Trudeau noted that less than 1% of illegal border crossings and less than 1% of fentanyl into the US come from Canada,[154]he unveiled a $1.3 billion security plan for theCanada–US borderon December 16, 2024.[155][156]Despite these efforts, on February 1, Trump ordered the tariffs to begin February 4, with a reduced 10% rate for Canadian energy products.[154][157]Bloomberg Newsreported that Trump advisorsPeter NavarroandStephen Millerled the economic discussions on the tariffs.[158]\n
Trudeau and Sheinbaum condemned Trump's actions and threatened immediate economic retaliation, but on February 3, the three leaders negotiated a one-month delay on the tariffs. As part of the agreement, Mexico committed to deploying 10,000 troops to its border with the United States, while Canada pledged to appoint a "fentanyl czar" and continue implementing the border security plan announced in 2024.[159][160]In return, Trump pledged to take measures to curb weapons trafficking to Mexico and to collaborate with Canada on a joint anti-crime "strike force".[161][162]\n
However, on February 27 Trump claimed that "drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada" and reaffirmed his planned tariffs,[163]leading to their implementation on March 4, 2025.[164]Canada retaliated with 25% tariffs on $20 billion (CA$30 billion) in US goods, with plans to expand to $85 billion (CA$125 billion),[165]while Mexico prepared its response for March 9.[166]TheWall Street Journalwarned the tariffs had "the potential to profoundly reshape relations between the US and two of its biggest trading partners, abruptly reversing America's decades-long project of expanding free trade with its allies."[167]\n
The onset of the trade war triggeredstock marketdeclines and economic concerns, particularly for retailers andcar manufacturers.[168]Lutnick quickly signaled tariff reductions. "The president is listening to the offers from Mexico and Canada. He's thinking about trying to do something in the middle," he said on March 5.[169]The same day, Trump delayed tariffs onUSMCA-compliant automakers.[73]The next day, he extended the delay to all USMCA-compliant goods until April 2.[170]While only 50% of Mexican and 38% of Canadian imports were officially compliant in 2024,[170]many companies skipped the paperwork since their goods already qualified for low tariffs undermost favored nationrules. Officials from both countries expected most exports to be compliant within weeks.[171][172]Canada kept its initial tariffs but suspended the planned increase.[173]Tens of thousands of Mexicans celebrated with Sheinbaum in Mexico City's central plaza.[174]\n
Although the USMCA exemption was expected to expire on April 2, that day the White House announced it would continue indefinitely. However, Trump signed new orders imposing 25% tariffs on imports of steel, aluminum, automobiles, and auto parts from any country, including Canada and Mexico.[74]Canada, the US's largest supplier of steel and aluminum, was significantly impacted by US tariffs on these products, and retaliated on March 13 with 25% tariffs on an additional $20.6 billion (CA$29.8 billion) of US goods.[175]On April 9, Canada implemented a 25% tariff on US-made vehicles that are not compliant with the USMCA.[176]\n
On April 10, 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Brazilian PresidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvamet in a regional summit inHonduras, as a counterweight to U.S. President Donald Trump's shifting positions on global tariffs, decided to intensify the relations between their governments and the business sectors of Brazil and Mexico, in a joint economic front that hopes to recognize that Latin America and theCaribbeanrequire unity and solidarity, as later stated by Sheinbaum.[177]\n
On April 11, 2025, Donald J. Trump, despite the "walk back on April 9, threatened Mexico with new tariffs, stating that Mexico was required to send 1.75 million acre-feet of water from theRio Grande, via numerous dams andreservoirs, according to a1944 agreement, with Trump stating that Mexico only fulfilled 30% of the agreed quota.[178][179]He also added that "Mexico has been stealing the water from Texas Farmers".[180]President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the reason the quota was not fulfilled was due to a "thee-years drought", suggesting that an alternative agreement can be reached.[179]\n
On February 1, 2025, Trump signedExecutive Order 14195to establish a new 10% baseline tariff on all Chinese imports, accusing China of exporting fentanyl into the US.[181][182]This measure applied in addition to tariffs remaining from Trump's first term, which averaged 20%.[183]The order, which went into effect on February 4, was encouraged by theNational Security Council.[158]China retaliated on February 10 with tariffs of 15% on coals andliquefied natural gasand 10% on oil and agricultural machines. China also addedPVH Corp.andIlluminato theUnreliable Entity List, launched an antitrust investigation into Google, and addedexport controlsto some metals includingtungsten.[184][185]Capital Economics, a UK-based macroeconomic research consultancy, estimated that while the US levied new tariffs on about $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, China's additional tariffs only targeted about $20 billion of US goods. Julian Evans-Pritchard, the firm's head of China Economics, stated "The measures are fairly modest, at least relative to US moves".[185]American retailers includingWalmart,Costco, andTargetattempted to pressure their Chinese suppliers into absorbing some of the increased costs.[186][187]\n
On March 4, 2025, Trump raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports again from 10% to 20%.[163][188]China retaliated by imposing a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, as well as a 10% tariff on US sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, effective March 10, 2025.[189][190]China also launched an anti-circumvention investigation into optical fiber products imported from the United States.[191]TheGeneral Administration of Customsof China suspended US lumber imports and revoked soybean import licenses for three US firms.[192]On March 30, 2025, China,South Korea, and Japan's trade ministers met for the first time in five years. The officials discussed goals for atrilateral free trade agreementand enhanced supply-chain cooperation in response to Trump tariffs.[193][194]\n
On April 2, the US added a 34% "reciprocal tariff" on top of pre-existing orders, resulting in an effective minimum tariff of 54% on all imports from China. Products subject to Section 301 tariffs from Trump's first term faced total rates as high as 76%.[195]The Chinese government retaliated with tariffs of 34% on all imports from the United States, effective April 10, 2025[196]and suspended negotiations regardingthe sale of TikTok.[197]China also began requiring special licenses to export sixheavy rare-earths, 100% of which were refined in China, andrare-earth magnets, 90% of which are produced in China.[198]The rare earths, difficult to substitute, are critical to a range of high-tech goods, including batteries, weapons, and medical devices.[199]China was slow to develop the export licenses and halted all exports in the meantime.[198]\n
In response, Trump added an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods beginning April 9, raising the baseline tariff to 104%.[200][201]China responded with an extra 50% retaliatory tariff as well, bringing their tariff on American goods to 84%.[202]The US then raised to 145%,[3]and on April 11, China raised to 125%. The statement added that China would ignore any further US tariff rises.[203]The Commerce ministry stated, "Even if the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy."[204]\n
In February 2025, Indian Prime MinisterNarendra Modivisited the White House to negotiate tariffs and advance a deal aimed at doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.[205]India's trade-weighted average tariff was 12%, compared to the United States' 2.2%, leading to Trump repeatedly calling the country "tariff king" and a "big abuser" of trade ties.[206][207]The US was India's largest export market.[208]Analyses projected reciprocal tariff measures would have significant economic impacts to India.Citi Researchestimated that India could lose $7 billion annually.[205]An internal Indian analysis estimated that reciprocal tariffs would affect 87% of its total exports to the US, valued at $66 billion. India estimated increases of 6% to 10% in tariffs on items such as pearls, mineral fuels, and machinery and believed its $11 billion worth of pharmaceutical and automotive exports would see the highest impact.[206]\n
India took several steps to address trade concerns. In February, it reduced tariffs on motorcycles and whiskey, pledged to review additional tariffs, and offered to increase US energy and defense equipment imports.[205]The following month,Reutersreported that India was negotiating with the US and was open to lowering or eliminating tariffs on 55% of its imports from the US, valued at $23 billion, which were currently subject to tariffs ranging from 5% to 30%. India warned the offer was contingent on relief from reciprocal tariffs and said decisions were not final.[206]On April 2, the US applied a 27% "reciprocal tariff" to India.[208]\n
By April 6, 2025, India signaled that it would negotiate with the United States and would not seek retaliatory tariffs.[209]\n
On April 2, 2025, Donald Trump imposed a 17% import duty on Israeli goods.[210]On April 3, 2025, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich would meet with other minister to decide a course of action.[211]By April 7, 2025, Israel had offered to remove tariffs on all US goods.[212]\n
On April 8, 2025,Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahuvisited Donald Trump to discuss multiple topics including tariffs. The US president declined to remove the 17% on Israel.[213]\n
After receiving a 25% tariff on cars and car parts and a 24% tariff on other goods exported to the United States, Japan'sNikkei 225 stock market indexfell by 7.8% on April 7, which was the third-largest single-day loss in its history.[214]Since Japan is an export-heavy economy and Japan's large automotive sector depends on the United States for 20% of its total exports, Trump's new tariffs had a sizeable effect on the Japanese economy. Analysts estimate that the tariffs could decrease Japan's GDP by 0.8%.[215][216]\n
Prime MinisterShigeru Ishibasaid tariffs were "extremely disappointing and regrettable."[216]On April 7, Ishiba talked with Donald Trump by phone, asking the president to reconsider, but was unable to negotiate any concessions.[217]Trump later wrote "He is sending a top team to negotiate!" onTruth Social.[217]\n
On April 2, 2025, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on all goods coming from Singapore.[218]At an address to theSingapore Parliamenton April 8,Prime Minister of SingaporeLawrence Wongstated "what the U.S. is doing now is not reform" and "it is rejecting the very system it created." He also stated that "these measures will accelerate the fracturing of the global economy."[219]He also announced the creation of a national task force to support businesses and workers affected by the tariffs.[220]On April 8, 2025, the Singaporean prime minister's office stated that it would not retaliate on U.S. tariffs.[221]\n
On April 2, 2025, Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs of 25% on South Korea. With this, the South Korean government announced emergency support for its auto industry.[222]On April 8, 2025, South Korea's acting president,Han Duck-soo, called for negotiation rather than retaliation.[223]Trump said that he discussed the tariffs with Han in a phone call and South Korea's finance minister will be meeting with US Trade RepresentativeJamieson Greerfor negotiations.[224]\n
On April 2, 2025, Donald Trump announced a "reciprocal tariff" of 32% on Taiwanese goods,[225]but excluded semiconductor products, the island's primary exports.[226]Trump had previously criticized Taiwan for gaining an unfair dominance in the semiconductor industry and not spending enough on its own defense.[226]Taiwan's government called the tariffs "unreasonable" but chose not to retaliate, instead offering to increase imports from the US and remove all tariffs on American goods.[227][228]\n
The new tariffs exacerbated public concerns over the level of support from the United States.[229]TheKuomintangsaid that the tariffs were a heavy blow to presidentLai Ching-te's policy of depending on the US to counter China and castigated the government's unpreparedness and ineffective response.[230]On April 7,PremierCho Jung-taiconvened a meeting at theExecutive Yuanwithlegislativecaucus leaders across party lines to discuss the potential impacts of the US tariff hike on Taiwan. During the meeting, Premier Cho expressed appreciation for their participation and emphasized that the government had completed assessments on both macroeconomic and sector-specific levels. He presented a NT$88 billion plan and urged collaboration between the executive and legislative branches to expedite budget review and implementation, with the goal of stabilizing the economy and supporting industries through the challenges ahead.[231]\n
On February 10, 2025, Trump renewed a 25% tariff on all steel imports originally imposed during his first term and increased aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%. While other countries had previously received exemptions, Vietnam had not, meaning its steel and aluminum exports were already subject to U.S. tariffs. The hike in aluminum tariffs further strained Vietnamese industries and exporters.[232]\n
Vietnam's large trade surplus in goods with the US made it a target for reciprocal tariffs.[232]On March 13, 2025, trade ministerNguyễn Hồng Diênarranged a meeting with Lutnick and Greer to try to secure a bilateral trade agreement.[233][234]He ended up receivingMarc Knapper, a US Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador, on March 14.[235]Knapper reassured him that the US tariff measures were not aimed at Vietnam and were meant to promote fair trade and American workers.[236]\n
On April 2, 2025, Trump presented with a 46% reciprocal tariff on Vietnam, shocking Vietnamese exporters.[237]Vietnamese leaders tried to approach Trump diplomatically to find an agreement to remove the tariffs or to delay them.[238]Vietnam's top leader,To Lam, asked President Trump to delay the imposition of tariffs for at least 45 days on April 5, with little result.[239]Vietnam then offered to eradicate all US import tariffs, but Peter Navarro shot down the deal, saying "it's the non-tariff cheating that matters".[240]TheVN Indexfell by 7% after the announcement of the tariffs, practically the biggestcrashever since the establishment of the Vietnamese stock market.[241]\n
During Trump's first term,Nigeriacontinued to benefit from theAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, a US trade initiative established in 2000 to improve economic relations withSub-SaharanAfrican countries by providing duty-free access to the US market for eligible nations.[242]However, analysts were quick to notice that Nigeria was one of 48 nations with whom the United States maintained a trade imbalance. In 2024, Nigeria exported $5.29 billion in commodities to the United States while receiving $3.88 billion, resulting in a $1.4 billion trade surplus for Nigeria, making it a likely target of Trump's renewed foreign tariff policies.[242][243]\n
On April 2, Trump announced a 14% tariff on Nigerian goods.[244]The Nigerian government avoided retaliation. Instead, Trade MinisterJumoke Oduwolesaid Nigeria would contact the WTO to find a mutually beneficial solution.[245]Despite pledging to not retaliate, the minister did highlight the risks for AGOA and the Nigerian oil industry, whilst also stating this development had the chance to boost Nigeria's non-oil exports as well as meeting global standards and improving market acceptance into more economies across the globe. She also emphasized the urgent need to enhance intra-African trade through theAfrican Continental Free Trade Area(AfCFTA).[246]Since Nigeria relies on crude exports for 90% of its foreign exchange, immediate consequences were apparent withNigeria's central bankselling nearly $200 million to support thenaira currency.[247]\n
After Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported steel and aluminum, major exporters in South Africa were palpable by the onset tariffs,[248]leading theSteel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa(SEIFSA) condemning the U.S. tariff hike and warning of negative impacts on local manufacturing, as well as calling on the South African government to take immediate action.[249]\n
Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs of 31% on South Africa on April 2, 2025.[250]This move, according to the government of South Africa, effectively nullified the benefits African countries enjoy under U.S. trade initiative the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).[251]On April 4, 2025, South Africa's government announced that it would not retaliate and would instead negotiate exemptions.[252]\n
After the reciprocal tariffs were announced,Trade and Industry Minister Parks Taustated that South Africa would start to plan to diversify its export markets, targeting regions in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and within Africa.[253]Another immediate consequence was the postponing of the sale of gems fromPetra Diamonds'Cullinan Mine, due to uncertainty caused by the tariffs.[254]\n
On April 2, 2025, Trump imposed 18% tariffs on Zimbabwe as part of its "reciprocal tariffs" policy.[255]On April 6, 2025, Zimbabwe became the first country to scrap tariffs on all US goods. The president of Zimbabwe,Emmerson Mnangagwa, has stated that the move was made to foster a positive relationship with Donald Trump's government.[256]\n
Before his second inauguration, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Europe unless it reduced its trade surplus with the US by increasing imports of American cars, agricultural products, and oil and gas.[257]The US and theEuropean Union(EU) traded a record $1.6 trillion in 2023. TheEuropean Commissionpointed out that while the US ran a trade deficit with the EU in goods, it was offset by a trade surplus in services.[258]On February 2, 2025, Trump told reporters he planned to impose tariffs on theEuropean Union"pretty soon". He also suggested tariffs on the UK "might happen" but believed "that one can be worked out".[259]\n
Some EU leaders threatened immediate retaliation while others expressed concerns aboutreigniting global inflation.[260][261][262]"We have to do everything to avoid this totally unnecessary and stupid tariff war," said Polish Prime MinisterDonald Tusk.[260]On February 4, 2025, EU trade ministers met inWarsawto discuss Trump's threats.[263]On February 7, the EU proposed lowering tariffs on car imports from 10% to closer to the US' 2.5% rate and to increase purchases of American liquefied natural gas and military equipment.[264]\n
On February 25, French PresidentEmmanuel Macronmet with Trump at the White House and aimed to persuade him to refrain from initiating a trade war with Europe and to concentrate on China instead.[265][266][267]\n
On March 12, after Trump's global steel and aluminum tariffs took effect, the European Union announced a two-phase retaliatory plan.[268]Initially scheduled to begin April 1, both phases were postponed to mid-April.[269]Phase one is reinstating tariffs imposed in 2018 and 2020 in response to Trump's first-term metal tariffs. These measures, valued at €6.3 billion in 2018 but reduced to €4.5 billion in 2025 due toBrexitand declining US–EU trade, were suspended in 2023 after negotiations with then-presidentJoe Biden.[270]Phase two introduces tariffs targeting €18 billion worth of US industrial and agricultural goods, including steel, aluminum, home appliances, wood products, poultry, beef, and other food imports.[268][271]Trump condemned the EU's planned 50% tariff on US whiskey and threatened to impose 200% tariffs on European alcohol in response.[272]\n
In the lead-up to the imposition of Trump's reciprocal tariffs,Bernd Lange, Chairman of theINTA, proposed retaliating with "tariffs on digital services on which the US has a huge surplus".[273]\n
AYouGovpoll conducted in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK found that large majorities–from 79% of respondents in Denmark to 56% in Italy–support imposing retaliatory tariffs on American imports if the US tariffs continue.[274]\n
On March 27, 2025, the United States imposed a 25% tariff on all car imports.[78]Because Germany is the world's largest automobile exporter, it could see price increases among auto parts and automobiles in general.[275]In response of this, German economy ministerRobert Habeckstated that his country, along with the rest of Europe, would exert pressures on the United States, including reciprocal tariffs.[275]\n
On April 2, 2025, Trump imposed 20% tariffs on all goods coming from the European Union as part of his "reciprocal tariff" policy.\n
On April 7, EU leaders offered the United States a "zero-for-zero" tariff deal on industrial goods, including cars, pharmaceuticals, and machinery. A similar agreement was nearly reached during negotiations over the proposedTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which Trump halted during his first term. The EU averaged a tariff of 1.6% on non-agricultural goods.[276]\n
On April 9, EU approved the first set of 25% retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. goods, which start being collected from April 15.[277]However, on April 10 the European Union suspended for 90 days its countermeasures against the U.S. following Trump's postponing his own tariffs the day prior.[278]On April 11, it was stated fromUrsula von der Leyenthat if dialogue with the US failed after the deadline, the EU would unleash the "EU trade bazooka measures",[279]mentioning that she was ready to dramatically expand the transatlantic trade war, with the possibility to include a tax on digital advertising revenues that would hit tech groups such asMeta, Google.[279][280]She also stated that the EU would not tolerate Chinese goods hit by US tariffs being redirected by China to the EU, mentioning plans to put some regulations as to limit Chinese imports.[280]\n
Trump did not announce tariffs on Russia in April 2025, due to sanctions related to theUkraine war.[281][282]The White House said that the imposed sanctions "already rendered trade between the two countries as zero."[283]U.S. trade with Russia in 2024 has been estimated at $3.5 billion, a tenth of the $35 billion from 2021 before it invaded Ukraine.[281]\n
Pursuant to section 201(a) of theSergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Actof 2012 (P.L. 112–208), the U.S. Trade Representative will annually submit a report to the Committee on Finance of the U.S. Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the U.S. House of Representatives assessing the extent to which Russia is implementing the WTO Agreement. According to the Report "USTR plans to take to press Russia to comply with its WTO obligations."[284][285]On August 22, 2012, Russia joined the WTO. The MFN rule requires that a WTO member must apply the same conditions on all trade with other WTO members, i.e., a WTO member has to grant the most favorable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members.[286]"Grant someone a special favor and you have to do the same for all other WTO members."[287]On March 16, 2022, the WTO published a letter from Russia where it stated that the implementation of import tariffs (by the U.S. and G7) aboveMFN ratesis clearly inconsistent with the relevant provisions of theGATTandGATS: "The Russian Federation would like to draw the attention of WTO Members to dangers looming over the multilateral trading system because of the recent aggressive and politically motivated trade restrictive actions of certain Members. Direct violations of the basic WTO rules by these Members have put severe pressure on global supply chains".[288]\n
In 2022, it was explained what revocation of MFN status means: "In practice, should Congress pass such a law, buyers of Russian goods would no longer pay the current U.S. tariff rate. Instead they would pay the rates created in the 1930Smoot-Hawley Tariff Actduring theHoover presidency.  These rates are now listed in Column 2 of theU.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule. More broadly, standard estimates of Smoot-Hawley average tariffs are about 20% overall, based on dividing tariff revenue by import value, as opposed to 2.8% in 2021 (or 1.4% excluding the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods and metals) or an even higher average of 59% excluding duty-free goods. As the averages and the umbrella example both suggest, non-MFN tariffs are generally seen as quite punitive, and often are so in reality."[289]U.S. Congress in 2022 voted to revoke Russia's "most favored nation" trade status: "There are two categories you can be characterized under U.S. law: One gets lower tariffs, and one gets higher ... For non-MFN, the average is around 20%".[290]On April 8, 2022, the President signed H.R. 7108, the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act. With this legislation, imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are subject to the rates of duty set forth in Column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). This legislation also granted authorization to the President to proclaim increases in the Column 2 rates of duty applicable to the products of Russia or Belarus. The page on cbp.gov was last modified on January 31, 2025.[291]By Proclamation 10420 of June 27, 2022, Biden increased duties on certain articles from the Russian Federation.[292]\n
Since 2019, theWTO's dispute settlement mechanismhas been de facto paralyzed due to the United States vetoing the appointment of judges to theWTO's Supreme Appellate Body, and without a functioning Appellate Body, no final rulings can be made.\n
On March 7, 2022, theGovernment of Russiain the first time approved alist of foreign states and territories that commit unfriendly actsagainst Russia, its legal entities and individuals. It includes the USA.[293][294]The Russian Federation believes that the countries that have restricted trade with Russia have directly violated the rules of the World Trade Organization. Russia distributed a statement to members of the organization, and the World Trade Organization published it on its website.[295]Russian Prime MinisterMikhail Mishustinhas imposed increased tariffs of 35% on goods from unfriendly countries, including the USA.[296][297]As of December 31, 2024, the full list of goods subject to import duties of 20–50% from unfriendly countries including the U.S., is established by the government decree No. 2240 of December 7, 2022, which has been amended several times.[298]Under President Trump's second term, all previous measures remain in place.\n
As of April 3, 2025, according toKommersant's source in theEurasian Economic Commission, which regulates the import duties of theEurasian Economic Unioncountries, the tariffs are unlikely to change, stating that, "The Union as a whole is not significantly affected by the tariff increase, most countries will be subject to a duty of 10%, which in the new realities can be considered themost favourable treatment". At the same time, Russia itself has sufficient freedom to impose unilateral restrictive measures, which often happened after 2022. If Russia finds itself hit by other countries raising duties in response to a US import tariff hike, it will still have the option to respond accordingly.[299]On April 6, 2025, theRussian Ministry of Economic Developmentresponded to Trump's tariffs and the situation in the world that "Most WTO members have mechanisms to respond to imports that damage the domestic economy. Both Russia and the EAEU have such mechanisms. There are public procedures, requirements and criteria that allow both the government and Russian companies to initiate appropriate decisions on market protection."[300]On April 9, Deputy Prime MinisterAlexei Overchuksaid that Russia has no significant trade with the United States: "As for our country, on the one hand, a record number of sanctions have been imposed on it, aimed at curbing our development, and on the other hand, Russia still has no significant trade with this country".[301][302]\n
The United Kingdom chose not to retaliate against President Trump's metal tariffs.[64]ChancellorRachel Reevesof theLabour Partystated that discussions were "ongoing" regarding a potential reduction of the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) to prevent further trade disputes with the United States. Introduced in 2020, the UK's DST imposes a 2% levy on large digital companies, generating approximately £800 million annually. The proposal to reduce the tax faced criticism from theLiberal Democrats, who condemned it as a "tax handout to Elon Musk, Zuckerberg, and other US tech barons" and instead advocated for an increase to 6%.[303]\n
On April 3, 2025, the UK government published a 417-page list, which asked British businesses to point to products where tariffs would hurt British companies the least.[304]\n
On April 2, 2025, Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs of 10% on El Salvador.[305]Two days later, El Salvadoran president,Nayib Bukele, hailed the move as a great idea, stating that long-term thinking was better than short term thinking.[306]\n
On February 4, 2025,Treasurer Jim Chalmersaddressed concerns regarding potential U.S. tariffs on Australian imports, mentioning that whilst he did not rule out the possibility of imposing counter-tariffs in case Australia was targeted by Trump, he preferred to avoid retaliatory measures.[307]\n
After the announcement of a 25% tariff of steel and aluminum,Prime Minister Anthony Albaneseengaged in discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump to achieve some kind of exemption, which ended up with a statement from the White House which expressed concerns about Australia allegedly disregarding past commitments to restrain aluminum exports.[308]Despite Albanese's efforts, the U.S. officially imposed a 25% tariff on Australian steel and aluminum, leading to him calling it an "unjustified" action, however confirming that Australia would not retaliate.[309]Despite this, Trade MinisterDon Farrellcontinuously attempted to achieve some kind of exemption through negotiations, but to no avail.[310]\n
Donald Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Australia as part of the "reciprocal tariffs" on April 2, 2025.[311]On April 3, 2025, Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese stated that he would negotiate with the United States to remove tariffs and would not impose reciprocal tariffs as he believed that trade wars are a race to the bottom.[211]\n
In reaction to the tariffs, Prime Minister Albanese released a five-point strategy to mitigate the damage inflicted upon impacted industries.  The strategy includes a $50 million assistance package to help industries like beef exports find new customers.[312]\n
On April 9, 2025, Australia declined China's ambassador to AustraliaXiao Qianoffer to 'join hands' on Trump's tariffs.[313]\n
On February 4, 2025,Fiji's Minister for Trade,Manoa Kamikamica, stated that, while it was premature to determine the effects onFijias a result of the 25% tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China, there were concerns that this was the first step toward a global trade war that would also engulf Fiji, fearing that Fiji could become one of Trump's future targets.[314]\n
However, on February 19, 2025, Acting Prime Minister and Minister for FinanceProfessor Biman Prasad, countered Manoa's earlier preoccupations and instead suggested that the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China won't affect Fiji, and instead they might have actually brought benefits to Fiji, stating that "countries like Fiji could see cheaper goods flowing through the Pacific as these nations look to offload excess capacity".[315]Professor Biman Prasad later added 3 days later that Fiji's economic fundamentals had improved during the last two years and affirmed that the administration did not see any immediate risks that may disrupt its economic prospects.[316]Even so, Fijian analysts continued to speculate that the increased price of imported alluminium and steel could possibly impact the Fijian economy.[317]\n
On April 2, Donald Trump announced "reciprocal tariffs" on Fiji, amounting to 32%, despite the Fijian government only imposing less than 2% import duties on average on all U.S. imports.[318]Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabukaadmitted that his government was not ready for Donald Trump's 'reciprocal tariffs' and was caught by surprise.[319]Regarding his possible plans going forward, he then stated that, "The world is bigger than the United States" and that Fiji would have to look at new sources of imports and new markets for their exports.[319]The immediate effects of such tariffs hit products such asFiji Water,kava,daloandturmeric, which are amongst the biggest exported products from Fiji towards the USA.[320]Fiji's Finance Minister said that the 32 percent tariff by the Trump Administration – the highest in the Pacific – is unfair, while a government spokesperson said he did not understand how the region threatens the American economy.[321]\n
On April 10, 2025, following Trump's "walk back", Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade Manoa Kamikamica announced that a meeting with United States Trade Representatives was set to happen the following week.[322]\n
On January 6, 2025, Brazil's Secretary of Foreign Trade,Tatiana Prazeres, stated that "Brazil should not be a primary concern for the U.S. government" based on the fact that while Brazil maintained a surplus in its overall trade balance, it continued to face a deficit with the United States, helping the nation to avoid tariffs.[323]However, after Trump's remarks, calling Brazil and some other nations "tremendous tariff makers",[324]Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva vowed to reciprocate if Trump imposed tariffs on Brazil.[325][326]However, following Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, Brazilian Foreign MinisterAlexandre Padilhasaid that Brazil would not engage in retaliation.[327]\n
On April 2, 2025, Donald Trump imposed the base 10% tariff on Brazil.[328]On April 3, 2025, Brazil's government stated that it would explore options include resorting to the World Trade Organization. Further, the parliament passed a law to respond to trade measures such as tariffs.[211]\n
The reaction from Brazilian exporters were mixed, with coffee exporters seeing the opportunity to send morerobusta beansto the United States due to Brazil's international rivals being hit with even heavier charges,[329]and at the same time other companies, such asEmbraer,[330]worried for the rising costs.\n
On April 10, 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met in a regional summit in Honduras, as a counterweight to U.S. President Donald Trump's shifting positions on global tariffs, decided to intensify the relations between their governments and the business sectors of Brazil and Mexico, in a joint economic front that hopes to recognize that Latin America and the Caribbean require unity and solidarity, as later stated by Sheinbaum.[177]\n
On January 26, 2025,a dispute arose between Colombia and the USafter Colombian presidentGustavo Petrorefused to allow the landing of two US military aircraft carryingdeportedColombian nationals.[331]Petro called the treatment of deportees on military flights undignified and said he would accept deportation flights on civilian planes.[332]In response, Trump ordered retaliation against Colombia and its officials,[332]including 25 percent tariffs that would increase to 50 percent in one week if Petro did not reverse his position.[333]Petro responded by ordering a 25 percent tariff on the US that would also increase to 50 percent.[332]Hours later, the US said Colombia had agreed to "unrestricted acceptance" of deportees, including on military aircraft.[334]Colombia said it would "continue to receive" deported Colombians and would guarantee them "dignified conditions".[331]\n
In November 2024 and again in January 2025, Trump attempted to threatenBRICScountries saying they would face 100% tariffs if they attempted to replace the US dollar as areserve currency.[335]\n
As of April 3, 2025, according toKommersant's source in theEurasian Economic Commission, which regulates the import duties of theEurasian Economic Unioncountries, they are unlikely to change – this is a well-established opinion. "The Union as a whole is not significantly affected by the tariff increase, most countries will be subject to a duty of 10%, which in the new realities can be considered themost favourable treatment". At the same time, Russia itself has sufficient freedom to impose unilateral restrictive measures, which often happened after 2022. If Russia finds itself hit by other countries raising duties in response to a US import tariff hike, it will still have the option to respond accordingly.[299]\n
Immediately after Trump's announcement on April 2, markets sunk sharply lower. In Japanese markets, theNikkei 225dropped 2.8% while theTOPIXdropped 3.1%.[336]In Europe, theFTSE 100was down 1.6%, while theCAC 40in Paris fell 3.3%. The GermanDAXalso fell 3.1%.[337]In the United States, stockfuturestied to theS&P 500fell 3.9%.Dow Jones Industrial Averagefutures fell 2.7%, andNasdaq 100futures fell 4.7%.[338]\n

Although Trump's first term economic policy featured lower and more targeted tariffs with many exceptions, such as an exception forAppleproducts, Trump promised higher rates, broader impacts, and few exceptions in his second term.[344][345]According to theTax Foundation, the first Trump administration imposed new tariffs on approximately $380 billion worth of imports. Comparatively, the second Trump administration was expected to impact more than $1.4 trillion of imports by April 2025.[346]\n
At the start of his second term, confusion over rapidly fluctuating tariff levels and other economic policies created significant uncertainty for businesses and economists.[347][348]US GDP grew by 2.8% in 2024, the year before Trump's inauguration.[349]In March 2025, the Federal Reserve lowered its 2025 growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%,[350]while the OECD projected a decline to 2.2% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.[349]The Federal Reserve also increased average inflation expectations from 2.5% to 2.7%.[350]The US dollar value also decreased massively following the announcement compared to other currencies.[351][352][353][354]By April 4,JPMorgan Chaseforecasted a recession within the year.[355]\n
The expected impact of the threatened 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods is high. Grocery prices were expected to rise as two-thirds of US vegetable imports came from Mexico.[344]ThePeterson Institute for International Economicsestimated that such a tariff retained through 2029 would reduce the gross domestic product of the United States byUS$200billion.[356]According to the Budget Lab atYale University, American households would lose approximatelyUS$1,200in purchasing power.[357]\n
TheCouncil on Foreign Relationsnotes the energy sector of the American economy is expected to be among the most impacted by tariffs.[358]A 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports is expected to increase energy prices for American consumers, in part, because Canada is the biggest supplier of energy to the United States, including 61 percent of crude oil imports in 2021.[359]American refineries, particularly in the Midwest, rely on crude oil to process into gasoline, and projections indicate that gas prices could increase up to 50 cents per gallon in the region due to tariffs.[358]On February 2, 2025, Canadian companyIrving Oilreleased a statement, noting, "The majority of the product produced at our Saint John refinery is bound for the US market... This tariff will result in price increases for our US customers and have impacts on energy security and the broader economy."[360]During his campaign, Trump promised voters he would cut energy prices in half during his first year in office.[361]\n
Following his global tariff announcements and worldwide trade war on April 3,[362][363]the Yale Budget Lab calculated the average effective US tariff to be 22%, up from 11% before the announcement and at the highest level since 1909.[58]Inflation Insights stated the weighted average tariff rate was set to rise to around 25% to 30%, up from 2% in the prior year.[364]TheCato Instituteand other economists stated that the tariffs would "approach levels not seen since theSmoot-Hawley Tariff Actof 1930",[365]whichThe Wall Street Journalput at roughly 20% and lasted until theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Tradein 1947.[366]After adjusting for inflation, the tariffs amounted to the largest tax hike in U.S. history and triple the tax increase to fight World War II.[367]\n
EconomistMichael Hudsonhas argued that the tariffs have thepotential to disruptthe global economy by disrupting thebalance of paymentsbetween the United States and its foreign debtors. By reducing the export trade between the United States and countries targeted by the tariffs and raising the cost of dollar-denominated goods, the US makes it more difficult for those countries to pay their dollar debts. Hudson believes this could cause a debt crisis, and compares it to the historical examples of theLatin American debt crisisand the inter-allied repayment of loans during theWorld Wars.[368]\n
Before the situation spiraled into a frenzy, SenatorsChuck GrassleyandMaria Cantwellintroduced the bipartisanTrade Review Act of 2025, proposing amendments to the law aimed atseparation of powersand closing legal loopholes.[369]However, the law has not yet reached a consensus.Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thunereferred dismissively, "I don't think that has a future."[370]SenatorElizabeth Warren, calling it "a moment of truth for Republicans" to overturn the emergency declaration that President Trump used to justify tariffs impacting the families, businesses, and farmers they represent.[371]A similar bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep.Don Bacon, who stated, "The Constitution clearly gives the authority for taxes and tariffs to Congress. Our Founders created checks and balances for a reason," urging Congress to reclaim its responsibility.[372]\n
Lawmakers were also frustrated with how the world learned of Trump's decisions—through a social media platform operated byTrump's company, instead of through federal administration officials.[373]Democratic SenatorAdam Schiffcalled on Congress to investigate whether Trump had engaged in suspiciousinsider tradingormarket manipulationwhen he abruptly announced and paused the tariffs.[146]The media described the US economy, the government's handling of the jobs and retirement savings of millions of Americans, and the US's standing in global security, as having encountered an unprecedent crisis of trust because of the Trump administration's unrestrained behavior.[374][375]\n
Companies, business groups, trade associations and lawyers at home and abroad, as well as foreign governments, filed formal complaints challenging the legality of thewhite housetariff measures.[376][377][378][379][380]\n
Nomura Holdingsestimated that eliminating the USde minimisexemption for Chinese goods "would slow Chinese export growth by 1.3 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2 point".[89]When the US Congress raised thede minimislimit from $200 to $800 in 2016, they sparked a surge in US imports of cheap Chinese goods.[89]A 2023 USHouse Select Committeereport estimated that "nearly half" of allde minimisshipments originated from China. Chinese e-commerce companiesTemuandShein, estimated to comprise more than 30% of dailyde minimisexemptions to the US, onboarded more sellers with a physical presence in the US and expanded their distribution facilities beyond China, to mitigate the impact of losing the exemption.[91][88]\n
On February 7, 2025, Trump suspended closing the exemption for China until the Secretary of Commerce notified him that adequate systems to process and collect tariff revenue were in place.[91]The exemption is expected to be closed again on May 3, 2025.[381]\n
